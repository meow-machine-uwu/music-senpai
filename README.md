Scrape various metal sites.

Do you have spotify? Do you want to scrape your favorite metal sites for new releases and add them to a playlist? Then these scripts are for you.

## Dependencies
You need two things.

Firefox (for the geckodriver).
Spotify Developer ID and Secret (sign up here: https://developer.spotify.com/dashboard/login) (it takes like 10 seconds, super easy)

Once you have your spotify developer account, create a project. This project will tell you your client id and client secret which will be used later. You also want to edit the settings of your project to use the callback: http://localhost:8888/callback.
